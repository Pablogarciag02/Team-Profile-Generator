## About this Project
-It is crucial for every team to establish who does what and what their role is.

-Due to this, i developed a Team-Profile-Generator. Through several prompts, a manager is able to create an html page that contains the information of each team member and their roles.

-This in turn makes it easy for a manager to manage their team and for team members to know what their role is.

This project uses
[Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for running the unit tests
[Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)
